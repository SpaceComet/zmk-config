# control, add individual board + shield combinations to
# the `include` property, e.g:
#
# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "corne_left", "corne_right" ]
# include:
#   - board: bdn9_rev2
#   - board: nice_nano_v2

include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: corne_left nice_view_adapter nice_view
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: corne_right                            # without display support
    #shield: corne_right nice_view_adapter nice_view # with display support

# - Note -
# Since I only have a display on the left side, the right side should be set as 
# `shield: corne_right` but if I do that then It wont compile so I set it as is
# the right side had a display. If you don't want to do that then you will have to 
# compile it twice.
